<h1>Black Bird</h1>
<p>
	The Girl surveyed the edge of the forest, looking for the unfamiliar trailhead. At once she found it and having reached there,
	took a resolute glance over her shoulder, across the field, and down to her village in the distance. There was no turning back.
	She stepped onto the trail and started walking down it at a brisk pace. At first it was easy going, soft pine needles cushioning her steps,
	a gentle breeze blowing through the tree trunks. But the forest got denser, and the encroaching vegetation narrowed 
	her path. Gradually it got darker and darker. The breeze stopped and the air became like a vapor, thick and humid. The trail 
	narrowed to a sliver, and she had to fight through leaves and branches at every step. Finally when she thought it
	was not possible to go any further, she spotted a faint glow ahead. With a final push she got through, and landed on
	a small clearing, barely a few feet across. Light filtered from the canopy and cast eerie shadows on a carpet of ferns and moss.
	She looked up and saw a branch, and on the branch she saw two birds, a White Bird and a Black Bird.

	The Girl looked intently at the scene above as she caught her breath. She did not think it strange when the White Bird
	started speaking.
</p>
<p>"You found us at last, and not a moment too soon."</p>
<p>The Girl shook her head. She was not looking for anything, at least that she could remember.</p>
<p>"What... who are you?" she said.</p>
<p>"I am White Bird," he replied.</p>
<p>She shook her head again this time in unbelief, and struggled to come up with the rigth question.</p>
<p>"What are you here for?"</p>
<p>"I am White Bird, I watch over happy things."</p>
<p>"What happy things?"</p>
<p>"The making of a new friend, the returning of an old one, the births, the laughter of children, the flowers that come in
	the spring. All happy things."
<p>"Seems like a good job to have. What about you?" she said, looking at Black Bird." Do you look over sad things?"</p>
<p>White Bird answered, "Black Bird does not say much. And yes that is what he does."</p>
<p>"That seems very unfair. Why must he look over sad things?"</p>
<p>"It's not unfair as it seems," continued White Bird. "Sad things shine the light."</p>
<p>"What? Shine the light on what?"</p>
<p>"Into the depths," said Black Bird, surprising both the Girl and White Bird.</p>
<p>"Well, that does not make any sense,"" the Girl concluded. A bit frustrated, she turned to White Bird and asked, "Why should sad things even exist?"
<p>"You..." White Bird squinted as he replied, "ask too many questions." </p>
<p>Immediately the ground opened up underneath the Girl's feet. She let out a short scream as she slid into the darkness.</p>
