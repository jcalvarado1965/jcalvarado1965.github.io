<h1>Black Bird</h1>
<p>
	The Girl surveyed the edge of the forest, looking for the unfamiliar trailhead. At once she found it and having reached there,
	briefly glanced over her shoulder, across the field, and down to her village in the distance. There was no turning back.
	She stepped onto the trail and started walking down it at a brisk pace. At first it was easy going, soft pine needles cushioning her steps,
	a gentle breeze blowing through the tree trunks. But the forest got denser, and the encroaching vegetation narrowed 
	her path. Gradually it got darker and darker. The breeze stopped and the air became a vapor, thick and humid. The trail 
	narrowed to a sliver, and she had to fight through leaves and branches at every step. Finally when she thought it
	was not possible to go any further, she spotted a faint glow ahead. With a final push she got through, and landed on
	a small clearing, barely a few feet across. Light filtered from the canopy and cast eerie shadows on a carpet of ferns and moss.
	She looked up and saw a branch, and on the branch she saw two birds, a White Bird and a Black Bird.

<p>
	The Girl looked intently at the scene above as she caught her breath. She did not think it strange when the White Bird
	started speaking.
</p>
<p>"You found us at last, and not a moment too soon."</p>
<p>The Girl shook her head. She had not been looking for anything, at least that she could remember.</p>
<p>"What... who are you?" she said.</p>
<p>"I am White Bird," he replied.</p>
<p>She shook her head again this time a little annoyed, and struggled to come up with the rigth question.</p>
<p>"Why are you here?"</p>
<p>"I am White Bird, I watch over happy things."</p>
<p>"What happy things?"</p>
<p>"The making of a new friend, the returning of an old one, the births, the laughter of children, the first ray of sunshine on the morning dew. All happy things."
<p>"Seems like a good job to have. What about you?" she said, looking at Black Bird." Do you look over sad things?"</p>
<p>White Bird answered, "Black Bird does not say much. And yes that is what he does."</p>
<p>"That seems very unfair. Why must he look over sad things?"</p>
<p>"It's not unfair as it seems," continued White Bird. "Sad things shine the light."</p>
<p>"What? Shine the light on what?"</p>
<p>"Into the depths," said Black Bird, surprising both the Girl and White Bird.</p>
<p>"Well, that does not make any sense,"" the Girl concluded. A bit frustrated, she turned to White Bird and asked, "Why should sad things even exist?"
<p>"You..." White Bird tilted his head as he replied, "ask too many questions." </p>
<p>Immediately the ground opened up underneath the Girl's feet. She screamed and then fell silent as she slid into the darkness.</p>
</p>
<hr class="style-eight"/>
 <p>The Girl sat up like a loaded spring, her heart racing. Her mind drifted between two worlds as she surveyed the darkness. 
Gradually she recognized familiar, comforting shapes: her night stand, her dresser, her mirror, her bedroom window framing the starry sky.</p>
<p>"It was a dream," she thought. "But it was so real."</p>
<p>She got up and looked outside the window to the outline of the hills in the distance. She felt she even knew where the forest was, 
  but could not be sure. Her thoughts were interrupted by a soft knock on the door.</p>
<p>"Are you OK sweetheart?" A voice called from outside.</p>
<p>"It's nothing mom, just a bad dream," she said as she realized she must have actually screamed. She looked at the clock and it was only a quarter past three. 
Even though she felt tired, sleep did not come back easily.</p>
