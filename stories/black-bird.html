<h1>Black Bird</h1>
<p>
	The Girl surveyed the edge of the forest, looking for the unfamiliar trailhead. At once she found it and having reached there,
	briefly glanced over her shoulder, across the field, and down to her village in the distance. There was no turning back.
	She stepped onto the trail and started walking down it at a brisk pace. At first it was easy going, soft pine needles cushioning her steps,
	a gentle breeze blowing through the tree trunks. But the forest got denser, and the encroaching vegetation narrowed 
	her path. Gradually it got darker and darker. The breeze stopped and the air became a vapor, thick and humid. The trail 
	narrowed to a sliver, and she had to fight through leaves and branches at every step. Finally, when she thought it
	was not possible to go any further, she spotted a faint glow ahead. With a final push she got through, and landed on
	a small clearing, barely a few feet across. Light filtered from the canopy and cast eerie shadows on a carpet of ferns and moss.
	She looked up and saw a branch, and on the branch, she saw two birds, a White Bird and a Black Bird.
</p>
<hr class="style-eight"/>
<p>
	The Girl looked intently at the scene above as she caught her breath. She did not think it strange when the White Bird
	started speaking.
</p>
<p>"You found us at last, and not a moment too soon."</p>
<p>The Girl shook her head. She had not been looking for anything, at least that she could remember.</p>
<p>"What... who are you?" she said.</p>
<p>"I am White Bird," he replied.</p>
<p>She shook her head again this time a little annoyed and struggled to come up with the right question.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"I am White Bird. I watch over happy things."</p>
<p>"What happy things?"</p>
<p>"The making of a new friend, the returning of an old one, the births, the laughter of children, the first ray of sunshine on the morning dew. All happy things."
<p>"Seems like a good job to have. What about you?" she said, looking at Black Bird." Do you look over sad things?"</p>
<p>White Bird answered instead, "Black Bird does not say much. And yes, that is what he does."</p>
<p>"That seems very unfair. Why must he look over sad things?"</p>
<p>"It's not unfair as it seems," continued White Bird. "Sad things shine the light."</p>
<p>"What? Shine the light on what?"</p>
<p>"Into the depths," said Black Bird, surprising both the Girl and White Bird.</p>
<p>"Well, that does not make any sense,"" the Girl concluded. A bit frustrated, she turned to White Bird and asked, "Why should sad things even exist?"
<p>"You..." White Bird tilted his head as he replied, "ask too many questions." </p>
<p>Immediately the ground opened underneath the Girl's feet. She screamed and then fell silent as she slid into the darkness.</p>
</p>
<hr class="style-eight"/>
 <p>The Girl sat up like a loaded spring. Her heart was racing as her mind drifted from one world to another, and a different darkness appeared before her. 
Gradually she recognized familiar, comforting shapes: her nightstand, her dresser, her mirror, the bedroom window framing the night outside.</p>
<p>"It was a dream," she thought. "But it was so real."</p>
<p>She got up and looked out at the hills in the distance, and beyond at the dark mantle of sky studded with twinkling stars. 
    She felt she even knew where that forest was 
  but could not be sure. Her thoughts were interrupted by a soft knock on the door.</p>
<p>"Are you OK sweetheart?" A voice called from outside.</p>
<p>"It's nothing mom, just a dream," she said as she realized she must have screamed for real. She looked at the clock and it was only a quarter past three. 
Even though she felt tired, sleep did not come back easily.</p>
<hr class="style-eight"/>
<p>
    The next day the Girl wondered about the dream, if it was a dream, as she made her way to school. The day was uneventful, but 
    several times the teacher caught her absentminded, which was not her usual self at all. At the end of the school day she did not walk
    straight home but wandered through the village streets as if looking for someone. She sat on the steps surrounding a small square, giving
    up on something she could not describe. She looked at the afternoon sky, dotted with small clouds gently drifting to the eastern horizon.
    She began to look for shapes in the clouds.
</p>
<p>"There is a turtle!" she thought. "Or maybe a hat."</p>
<p>"That looks like a boat, like the ones that bring food down the river." She thought about how she loved to walk with her Mom to market day.</p>
<p>"That one is like a lizard. Yuck!" The Girl and the lizards were mortal enemies.</p>
<p>"Wait! That one is just like a white &mdash;"</p>
<p>"Woof!" she was interrupted by the sound of a creature at her feet.</p>
<p>She looked at the Dog sitting at the step below. It was just a puppy, no more than a year old, and had short brown hair. The 
    Dog's expression was hopeful, being accustomed to begging in the streets. The way the skin clung to its little body 
    made it clear though that the Dog had not been very successful. The Girl felt compassion and searched her bag for any leftovers.
    She took out some water and a biscuit, a rare find as she was not known for her lack of appetite. She placed them on 
    the step, and the Dog looked first at her and then at the strange offering. It did not mind though, and quickly downed the biscuit
    and lapped up the water. </p>
<p>"I wonder where you came from. Maybe someone is looking for you" said the Girl.</p>
<p>She glanced around, then looked at the Dog again "no, I don't think you are lost. In fact, I don't think you have ever been found."</p>
<p>"Never you mind, today I believe you have been found."</p>
<p>The Girl gave a little smile, and the Dog a little wagging of the tail. That is all that was needed to seal a friendship.</p>
<p>The Girl got up and started on her way home, and the Dog trotted beside her until she was near her house but stopped at some distance.
    She looked back as she walked in, wondering why it had stopped. The next day when she began her walk to school, she was surprised
    to see the Dog joining her from where it had stopped the day before. The Dog walked along with her until she reached the gates. That day she did
    not eat all her food, thinking she might see her new friend later, and was rewarded with a pair of longing eyes as she left the school. 
    The Dog ate from the Girl's hand this time and followed her like the day before. Again, it did not dare to come near the house.
    Soon after the Girl went in however, a big storm rose from the west and started pounding the valley. The Girl anxiously
    stared at the path to her house, thinking about her friend sheltering in the bushes. She could not resist long and went out braving
    the soaking rain. She crouched as she looked under each bush, until she spotted the curled little body with sad eyes. The Dog did not
    resist being picked up. By the time they got to the threshold they were both drenched. She paused briefly, thinking about what 
    she was doing. It is one thing to make a friend, and entirely another to make a family. 
    "You must be very quiet now," she said.
    Once inside she took her towel 
    and dried the Dog and hid it in a box. She first had to convince her parents which was no easy task, but the Girl was both
    resourceful and tenacious.
</p>
<p>It took some pleading, and the saddest face she could put on, but in the end she convinced her Dad, who then convinced her Mom
    that perhaps having an extra pair of watchful eyes around the house would be a good thing, even though no one really thought there was
    any danger. From that day the Girl and the Dog were inseparable. The Dog would sleep at the foot of her bed every night, walk her to 
    and from school every day and play games with her in the afternoon. 
    She taught the Dog how to do tricks and amazed her school friends by showing them what a smart animal she had. 
    The Dog was fiercely protective and barked angrily if it
    perceived anything that could harm the Girl, especially if it saw any lizards. Time passed 
    and the little puppy grew strong and healthy thanks to Mom's cooking, and the Girl got so used to her faithful companion 
    she could hardly imagine life without it.
</p>
<hr class="style-eight"/>
<p>
    One day the Girl and her Dad were in the garden, taking out weeds in preparation for the spring planting. It was the warmest day of
    the year, and they were both enjoying work, telling each other jokes and laughing. The Dog sat on a sunny patch, also 
    enjoying the scene, occasionally going after an insect springing up from the grass.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the Girl heard her Dad yell behind her, "Hey, hey!" and something in his voice alarmed her. She turned in time to see a snake,
    head raised high above the ground, moving steadily towards her Dad. The snake was agitated and dangerous. Her Dad froze
    for a moment, then tried to reach for a stick on the ground but tripped and fell backwards. The snake picked up the pace and the Girl screamed
    "Daddy!". Then she saw a blur of brown darting from her right and stopping between the snake and her Dad. The Dog started growling
    and barking ferociously, like she had never heard before. The snake stopped but was not deterred and tried shifting quickly to the left
    and right. The dog matched the snake's speed, and at the last moment it lunged forward and bit the snake's body hard. The snake 
    however twisted its neck in a flash and sunk its fangs deep into the Dogs neck. The Dog let out a short yelp and released the wounded snake,
    which slithered back into the bushes. 
</p>
<p>The Girl and her Dad were in shock. She looked at the Dog and for the first time saw fear in its eyes. She ran and sat down next to the Dog,
    picked it up and let it curl in her lap, while her Dad knelt beside her. The Dog started shivering, then shaking. Teary-eyed she 
    looked at her Dad and said, "Daddy don't let him die!" But her Dad only looked at her in anguish and shook his head. She moaned
    and gently stroked the Dog's head, and looked into its eyes, which were becoming glassier every minute. Slowly the shaking diminished, and 
    the Dog's body went limp.
</p>
<p>
    The girl started sobbing uncontrollably. She struggled to breathe, the pain being almost palpable, like
    a weight on her chest. Sorrow was a new experience and her mind tried to escape it even though she knew it was impossible. Her Dad held
    her tight and began to weep. She was almost resigned to this meaningless grief, when the seed of a thought began forming in her mind. 
    She looked intently at the lifeless body of the Dog and marveled at how deep the Dog's faithfulness had been. She looked at her own tears, still
    falling on the Dog's body, and marveled at how deep her love for the Dog was, now magnified by the sorrow. Then she looked at her Dad, a man she
    had never seen crying. In his tears she could now clearly see the depth of his love for her. She could see the depths.</p>
<p>The memory of her dream came back in an instant, and she understood it now. These things did not make up for what was lost. They did
    not take away the grief or explained why but did bring something that was precious: a shadow of meaning. She looked up at the trees above,
    and on a branch was a black bird. They stared at each other for a moment. The black bird nodded and took off in flight. The Girl
    followed it with her gaze, until it disappeared against the gray backdrop of the hills.
