<h1>Transmutation</h1>
<p>Maryam entered the small room, a lit lamp in hand, as the last rays of autumn sunset filtered through the simple window covers. Her husband lay in a low cot, his uneasy breathing the only sound breaking the quiet of the evening. She was tired, but did not want to let on. Her chores had stretched for longer than usual, and she knew she had to gather strength for this.
</p><p>
"Yosef", she called in a tender voice.
</p><p>
There was a slight stir under the covers and a pair of eyes opened and brightened. A smile nearly broke out.
</p><p>
"Sorry, I did not hear you. Sneaking in on me again?" A raspy reply came.
</p><p>
"Just as well," she said "how was your rest today?"
</p><p>
"Exceptional. I feel like a new man already." From any other person this would have come across quite sarcastic, but from him the ring of optimism made it entirely believable.
</p><p>
She knelt beside him and began running her fingers through the curls of his hair. 
</p><p>
"It’s starting to get dark, so I brought you a light." She was about to say something else but it escaped her, leaving a nagging feeling in the back of her mind.
</p><p>
"I hope you are not too worn out. I’m afraid I’ve managed to leave all the heavy lifting to you now." Yosef said.
</p><p>
"There is nothing to it. Plus I have all the good help," she replied.
</p><p>
"Really?"
</p><p>
"Your boys have been busy with all your jobs," she continued. "Today they nearly finished Eli’s door and also went to Anan’s house and mended the breached wall."
</p><p>
"Did they get paid?" He asked.
</p><p>
"You know Anan. It will be a few days but he will make good on it." She answered.
</p><p>
"I see then you must have spent your whole day in your room making yourself beautiful for me." He said with a smirk.
</p><p>
She mock-slapped his arm. "Right. I took care of the firewood. Did my turns pressing the olives and took the oil to the merchant. And yes I did get paid." She emphasized the last bit.
</p><p>
They looked at each other for some time. There were no words said, but it was as if an entire conversation was taking place.
</p><p>
Yosef broke the silence. "Now I know that you will all be Ok."
</p><p>
"Yosef! Don’t say it. I am sure you will be up soon and I will be dealing again with all the craziness that should be going on in this house!"
</p><p>
The truth was that she was not sure. It had all started like it was nothing. He complained about some pain in his side. Then he grew weak and started having difficulties with his work. Then a visit to the doctor. Then another doctor. Finally something that sounded like a death sentence: "tumors in the body", "no remedies", "probably only a couple of months". In faith she had stood her ground for weeks, only to see his life slowly dimming, like the sun behind the western hills outside her window. She knew God would always be faithful, but still she could not shake off this weight of pain and hopelessness. "Keep him comfortable. Give him a little wine every night to help him rest," were the doctor’s last words. Then she remembered.
</p><p>
"Let me get your wine so you will be set for tonight."
</p><p>
"I would really appreciate that," he said.
</p><p>
She got up, turned, and just as she crossed the threshold the nagging feeling became ominous. Then the thought came clear and loud: "we ran out of wine yesterday! Didn’t we?" She rushed downstairs, took the jar from the shelf and looked in. It was gone. She had been too busy and forgot to see the merchant. There was no way to go look for it this late in the evening. She had failed. Wanting to appear self-sufficient she had neglected the one thing that mattered, taking care of Yosef. These were the thoughts that assaulted her.
</p><p>
She fell to her knees, not knowing what to do, and began to weep. The weight of all the cares, worries and fears she had battled for weeks crashed down on her at once. She felt alone.
</p><p>
But she was not alone. A figure approached from the shadowed corridor.
</p><p>
"Mother?"
</p><p>
She quickly turned. "Yeshua!"
</p><p>
"What is it with you?" the boy said.
</p><p>
"I’ve… we’ve run out of wine for your father." She covered her mouth and closed her eyes. She did not want him to see her cry, not yet.
</p><p>
The boy looked intently at the jar, then picked it up and said "fill it with water."
</p><p>
Maryam struggled to make sense out of what he was saying, but somehow gave up on it and just stood in her daze, walked outside, slid the stone cover and dipped the jar in the cistern. When she came back Yeshua was standing with a cup in his hand.
</p><p>
"Here, pour it," he said.
</p><p>
A crimson liquid flowed into the cup. She had to taste it, and she did. Over the years she had seen some things, but this was too much; she was speechless. She took the boy in her arms and began to cry, this time out of relief. God had shouted "You are not alone! I will care for you!" and now she had heard it.
</p><p>
As she stood up the boy added a strange remark, "when you see this sign once more, you will know my hour has come." She went upstairs with the cup, wiped her eyes and added what had just happened to the growing treasure in her heart.
</p><p>
It would be a few years later, and a few miles away, when a similar situation in different circumstances would present itself to Maryam and Yeshua. She would remember this evening, and say the words that speak even today to all those who wish to see God’s transforming power in their lives: "Whatever He says to you, do it."
